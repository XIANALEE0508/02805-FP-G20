Norway/Vänern Line (Swedish: Norge/Vänerbanan) is a Y-shaped railway line in Sweden. The main section runs from Gothenburg Central Station to Kil Station, mostly along the west shore of Vänern. There is a branch from Erikstad to the Norway–Sweden border at Kornsjø, from where it continues as the Østfold Line to Oslo. The lengths of the line are 112 kilometres (70 mi) from Gothenburg to Erikstad, 180 kilometres (110 mi) from Gothenburg to Kornsjø and 232 kilometres (144 mi) from Gothenburg to Kil. The line is single track, except for the 82 kilometres (51 mi) section from Gothenburg to Öxnered, which is double track.
As of 2018, the following passenger rail services exist on the line:[2][3][4][5][6]
In addition, freight trains operate on the entire railway – from Gothenburg to Falun and to places in northern Sweden via Kil, and between Gothenburg and Norway via Kornsjø.[10]
The railways were finished in 1879. A shortcut at Erikstad was built for the Norway branch in 1995. The section from Gothenburg to Öxnered was rebuilt as a new double-track railway in the period 2005-2012.
The current name was introduced in 1990. From the construction until then, the name was Bergslagen Line, between Gothenburg, through Kil, to Falun, later Gävle. The line to Norway then started at Mellerud and was called Dalsland Line.
