At the time of thawing relations between South and North Korea, when the cross-border section of the Donghae Bukbu Line was reopened in 2007, the South Korean government considered the construction of a railway for freight traffic all along the east coast to the North Korean border.[3][4] As part of the corridor, a new single-track, non-electrified line for 150 km/h (93 mph) would connect Pohang and Samcheok, the end of a branch of the Yeongdong Line.[5] new line is to connect to the existing railhead at Samcheok. Work started on the Pohang-Yeongdeok section on March 20, 2008, with a foreseen budget of 2,949.5 billion won for the entire line until Samcheok.[6]  As of 2009, progress reached 5.9% of a planned budget reduced to 2,831.749 billion won, and completion of the 171.3 km (106.4 mi) long project was planned for 2016.[7]  Under the government's 2010 strategic plan for 2020, the Pohang–Samcheok extension is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h (140 mph).[2]
