The Ankara–Sivas high-speed railway (Turkish: Ankara–Sivas yüksek hızlı demiryolu), is a 406 km (252 mi) long high-speed railway  in Turkey and is the second longest high-speed railway in the country after the Ankara–Istanbul high-speed railway. Travel time between Ankara and Sivas was  reduced to 2 hours and 50 minutes,[2] from around 9 hours and 30 minutes with conventional trains.[3][4] The railway will also serve as an extension of the Ankara-Istanbul HSR with a total journey time from Istanbul to Sivas at around 7 hours. The line was opened on April 26, 2023.[5]
In order to reduce travel time between Ankara and Sivas, TCDD undertook a survey for a new high-speed railway line in 2004. Construction began in 2008 with some pauses in 2010 due to changes in the project. When completed, the Ankara-Sivas journey time is expected to be reduced to 2 hours and 50 minutes compared with a previous travel time of 12 hours. Testing on the line began in March 2020. The line partially opened in February 2023, and other portions started service in the April of the same year.
There are a total of 11 stations on the railway, five of which are in operation. With the exception of Ankara, Kayaş and Sivas stations,[6] every station on the railway has been built exclusively for high-speed train use. When the railway first opened to revenue service, on 26 April 2023, only two new stations opened: Kırıkkale YHT and Yozgat YHT. The remaining stations (not counting the existing stations) will be opened within 2023.
Constructions are divided into four sections:
