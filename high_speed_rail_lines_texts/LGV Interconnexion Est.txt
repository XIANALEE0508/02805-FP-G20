The LGV Interconnexion Est is a French high-speed rail line that connects the LGV Nord, LGV Est, LGV Sud-Est and LGV Atlantique through the suburbs of Paris. Opened in 1994, it consists of three branches, which begin at Coubert:
The south and west branches are now shared with the LGV Sud-Est line.
Maximum line-speed throughout is 300 km/h (186 mph).
Starting from the south (LGV Sud-Est), the line begins at Coubert junction and heads northeast. Near Tournan, there is a link to the Paris-Coulommiers line. Further north, Marne-la-Vallée – Chessy TGV station (transfer to the RER A) serves the new town of Marne-la-Vallée and Disneyland Paris theme parks. Near Claye-Souilly, two links under construction will join the line to the LGV Est. The route next serves Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV station (transfer to the RER B and air transport). Shortly thereafter, the line joins the LGV Nord at Vémars junction.
