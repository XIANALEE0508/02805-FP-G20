The Shanghai–Chongqing–Chengdu high-speed railway is a high-speed rail line under construction in China. The Chinese name of the railway line, Huyurong, is a combination of the abbreviations for Shanghai (沪, Hù), Chongqing (渝, Yú), and Chengdu (蓉, Róng). It will run in an east-west direction largely parallel to the Yangtze River, connecting the cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hefei, Wuhan, Chongqing and Chengdu.
Announced in 2016 as part of China's "Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal" network, the passage will comprise multiple railway lines and branch lines, including those currently operational as well as those under construction and under planning.
The railway's route is roughly parallel to the existing Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu passenger-dedicated railway, but has a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph) rather than the older line's 250 km/h (160 mph). The new line would provide a faster connection for the cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hefei, Wuhan, Chongqing and Chengdu.[1][2]
The line includes a number of interconnected routes, including two different main routes between Shanghai and Hefei, a more direct southerly route via Huzhou and a Yangtze north bank route. It also includes a southerly route from Yichang North to Chongqing and a northerly route from Yichang North to Chengdu. Yichang North will also eventually be a junction with the Hohhot–Nanning corridor.
