Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shenzhen, and Zhanjiang.[1] The Weifang–Qingdao stretch splits into two, one directly connecting Weifang to Qingdao, the other connecting Weifang to Qingdao through Yantai. As apart of China's "Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal" network, announced in 2016, this corridor is an extension of the Hangzhou–Fuzhou–Shenzhen passenger railway from "Four Vertical and Four Horizontal" network.[2] The line will comprise a mixture of high-speed railway lines, upgraded conventional rail lines and intercity railways.
