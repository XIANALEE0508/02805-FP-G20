The Qingdao–Yinchuan corridor (simplified Chinese: 青银通道; traditional Chinese: 青銀通道; pinyin: Qīngyín Tōngdào) is a China Railway High-speed line running from Qingdao, Shandong to Yinchuan, Ningxia. The line passes through the cities of Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan. Announced in 2016 as part of China's "Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal" network, the line comprises the existing Qingdao–Taiyuan passenger railway and the Taiyuan–Zhongwei–Yinchuan railway.
The Qingdao–Yinchuan corridor runs east–west ("horizontally") from the coastal city of Qingdao in Shandong Province, passing through Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan before terminating at Yinchuan in Ningxia.
Operational lines are marked with green background. The Taiyuan-Yinchuan section is not high-speed and does not yet have any through trains beyond Taiyuan South and is marked as blue.
