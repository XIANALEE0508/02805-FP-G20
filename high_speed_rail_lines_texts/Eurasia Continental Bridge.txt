The Eurasia Continental Bridge corridor (simplified Chinese: 陆桥通道; traditional Chinese: 陸橋通道; pinyin: Lùqiáo Tōngdào) is a high-speed rail corridor connecting Lianyungang, a port in northern Jiangsu province, to Ürümqi, the regional capital of Xinjiang. The corridor passes through the cities of Xuzhou (Jiangsu), Zhengzhou (Henan), Xi'an (Shaanxi), Lanzhou (Gansu), and Xining (Qinghai) en route. Announced in 2016 as part of China's "Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal" network, the rail corridor is an extension of the existing Xuzhou–Lanzhou high-speed railway.
The railway may be considered to be part of the New Eurasian Land Bridge.
