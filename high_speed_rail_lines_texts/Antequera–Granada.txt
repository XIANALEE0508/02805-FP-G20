The Antequera–Granada high-speed rail line opened in 2019, linking the Spanish city of Granada to the AVE network via a branch from the existing Madrid–Málaga high-speed rail line at Antequera.
The 122.8 km (76.3 mi) line from Antequera to Granada[2] is a part of the under construction Andalusian Transverse Axis high-speed rail line. The three times per day AVE service between Madrid Atocha and Granada covers the distance of 568 km (353 mi) in 3 h 5 min. The daily AVE train between Granada and Barcelona Sants connects the two cities in 6 h 25 min. S-102 and S-112 (Pato, max speed 330 km/h (210 mph)) trains are used for these services and all trains call at Córdoba, offering a journey time of 90 min from Granada.[3] The total cost of building the line was €1.4 billion.[4]
After branching from the existing Antequera-Santa Ana railway station, the line serves Loja and Granada. In 2019, construction was set to begin on a €16 million underground AVE station in Antequera town centre, making Antequera the only city in Spain outside of Madrid to have two high-speed rail stops.[5]
The line is used by AVE services to Madrid and one daily service to Barcelona. In November 2019, a daily patronage of 2,600 passengers using these services was reported.[6]
