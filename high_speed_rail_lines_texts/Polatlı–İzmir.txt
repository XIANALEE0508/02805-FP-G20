The Polatlı–İzmir high-speed railway is a 588 km (365.37 mi) long high-speed railway currently under construction in Turkey. Once completed, it will be the longest high-speed railway in the country, surpassing the Istanbul-Ankara HSR which holds the title since 2014.
The railway will split from the Polatlı-Konya high-speed railway about 27 km (17 mi) south of Polatlı junction, where the Polatlı-Konya HSR splits from the Istanbul-Ankara HSR, and head west to Afyonkarahisar, then it will parallel the Izmir-Afyon railway to Menemen, where it will join the railway just north of İzmir, to eventually terminate at Alsancak railway station. Travel times between Ankara-Afyon and Ankara-Izmir are expected to be 1h 30min and 3h 30min, respectively.
Construction of the initial section began in 2012, but was suspended in 2018 when almost 50% of the works had been completed on some sections. The construction was restarted in 2022,[2] and planned to be completed in 2027.[3]
Constructions are divided into six sections starting from the split point:
