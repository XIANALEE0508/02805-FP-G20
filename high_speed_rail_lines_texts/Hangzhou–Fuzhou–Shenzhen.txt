The Hangzhou–Fuzhou–Shenzhen railway, also called the Hangshen railway (Chinese: 杭福深客运专线, formerly 东南沿海快速通道 or 东南沿海铁路) is the dual-track, electrified, high-speed rail lines (HSR) in service along the southeastern coast of China, linking the Yangtze River Delta on the East China Sea and Pearl River Delta on the South China Sea.  It is one of the eight arterial high-speed rail corridors of the national 4+4 high-speed rail grid.[1] The southeast coast is the only region of high-speed rail construction where no previous conventional railroads existed.  Hence, the high-speed rail lines built on the southeast coast will, for the most part, carry both passenger and freight traffic, and will not be passenger-dedicated lines that comprise most of the other HSR corridors in China.
An additional bridge will be built across Hangzhou Bay for high-speed rail, which would provide a direct link between Shanghai and Ningbo.[2] The Southeast Coast HSR Corridor is approximately 1,745 km (1,084 mi) in length, and crosses three coastal provinces, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong.  Major cities along the route include Hangzhou, Ningbo, Taizhou and Wenzhou in Zhejiang; Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen and Zhangzhou in Fujian; and Chaozhou, Shantou, Shanwei, Huizhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong. The line was folded into the Coastal corridor as part of the reorganization into the national 8+8 high-speed rail grid.
All lines are now in operation.
