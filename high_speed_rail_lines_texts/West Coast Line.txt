The West Coast Line (Swedish: Västkustbanan) is a railway line between Gothenburg and Lund,[1] which runs along the West Coast of Sweden. It is electrified all the way. It was originally built in 1880-1995, but it is since 1980 being rebuilt to a fast fairly straight double track railway along a mostly new route, basically a new railway. This was as of 2024 was still not completed, as the part through Varberg and through Helsingborg are both single-track.
In northern Helsingborg the track follows a 150 year old right of way, which has tight curves together with a steep climb.[2] Passing trains must not run faster than 30 km/h during inclement weather. Double track construction takes place between 2020 and 2023.[3] although the track in northern Helsingborg will remain as it is for several more years.
A doubletrack tunnel under the city of Varberg is under construction since 2019.[4]
The local trains are branded Västtågen between Gothenburg and Kungsbacka and branded Pågatågen between Halmstad and Lund. The regional trains are branded Öresundståg and the fast trains are operated by SJ. All trains continue south of Lund.
